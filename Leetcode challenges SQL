This file is dedicated to the process of solving SQL challenges from the Leetcode. 

1. 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products 
Task: product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

- Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.


CODE : 

1sr trial : 

SELECT
  product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = "Y" AND 
WHERE recyclable = "Y";
______________________________---

2nd with Correction :

SELECT
  product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = "Y" AND recyclable = "Y";
_______________________________-

Thoughts and Understanding of the exercise : 

In the 1st trial I used 2 WHERE clause like I confused again it with CASE WHEN conditioning 
where we repeat that code CASE WHEN, but it seems that when you use WHERE clause it is only possible 
to use one time, and further set your condition. That's it. 




2. 584. Find Customer Referee

In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.

Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.
______________

Trials that did not work:

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id !=2 
____________________
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id <> 2 ;
________________

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id <> 2 ;
______________________________________________

Correct Solution : 

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id !=2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
____________________

THOUGHTS : 

As I see it is super important to be attentive to every detail of the challenge. The intuitive part of this exercise 
was that, correctly I used the (SELECT statement) and I was a bit confused with the filtering part with the WHERE clause,
at the beginning I was thinking let's use the = (equal operator) like setting the conditon to match to NULL and 1 . But asked
CHAT GPT how can I filter in SQL for example, I did not say give me the answer, but learned from other examples, how can 
we filter the where clause, for example , let say we dont want to include a particular value, we can simply like use the sign
!= (exclamation mark and equa) or <>  (greater or less) sign to exclude the value. It was true that way. But imagine, in that particular
column we have also NULL values. we need to use the logical operator (OR) and write the column name and write (IS NULL). To filter
we are saying exclude 2 and include all and null values also. That's it.
